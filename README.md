# MNIST-handwritten-digits-recognition
This project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The model is trained on 60,000 images and tested on 10,000. It achieves high accuracy and can also predict digits from user-uploaded images after preprocessing them, demonstrating practical digit recognition capabilities.
